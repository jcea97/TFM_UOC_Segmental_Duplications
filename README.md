# liCHi-C scripts

R scripts used for the analysis and visualization of **liCHi-C** data in the Final Project.

## Contents
- `liCHi-C_loading_and_EDA.R`: in this script we find the necessary functions to load, filter and build the final liCHi-C dataset, and to analyze and visualize trans interactions involving chrY.
- `liCHi-C_circos.R`: this second script is used for obtaining genomic annotations and SDs from hg38 (including an specific table for FANK1-related SDs), generate links and visualize them using Circos plots (chrY and FANK1 interactions for female and male samples)
